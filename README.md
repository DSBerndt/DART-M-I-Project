# DART-M-I-Project
Model of an applied version of NASA's DART:comet:

-In our simulation, we will include: the Sun, the Earth, the asteroid, and the DART. Our simulation will remain two dimensional. 

-All of the objects will interact solely through gravitational forces. For the Sun and Earth, we will use the correct numbers for masses, speeds and radii. The Sun will be stationary at the center of our system and the Earth will travel in a circular path. For the asteroid, we will choose a fixed mass, speed and radius. DART’s mass will be taken from the NASA mission’s page. However, DART’s initial speed will be variable in order to vary kinetic energy.
	
**Modeled scenario**: The asteroid is approaching the Earth along the path shown in the diagram to the left. If we were to launch the DART to make a collision with the asteroid, what would the relationship between the time of launch and the minimum kinetic energy required to save the earth be?
The time of launch: We will program a countdown until the collision between the asteroid and Earth. We will vary when the DART is launched from the Earth and record it.
The minimum kinetic energy required: We will determine the minimum kinetic energy in the DART for each launch time that successfully deflects the asteroid from the Earth.:bowtie:
